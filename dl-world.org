The following collection of materials targets /"Physics-Based Deep
Learning"/ (PBDL), i.e.Â the field of methods with combinations of
physical modeling and deep learning (DL) techniques. Here, DL will
typically refer to methods based on artificial neural networks. The
general direction of PBDL represents a very active and quickly growing
field of research.

#+CAPTION: An overview of categories of physics-based deep learning
methods
[[file:resources/physics-based-deep-learning-overview.jpg]]

Within this area we can roughly distinguish the following five
categories:

- /Physics-based design/: incorporate domain knowledge about the system
  in the architecture of the learning process, e.g., adapt the
  connectivity of a neural network such that it facilitates certain
  solutions.

- /Physics-based constraints/: guide and constrain the learning process
  with physical models, e.g., in the simplest case by including
  additional terms in the loss function.

- /Combined methods/: hybrid solvers that employ traditional numerical
  methods alongside deep-learning techniques to arrive at simulations
  methods that are improved in terms of, e.g., efficiency, accuracy,
  generalization etc.

- /Outer-loop optimizations/: approaches that aim for higher level
  control or inverse problems, typically with an outer loop around a
  simulation. Here, fast and differentiable models exhibit particular
  promise.

- /Applications/: there are also many methods that apply established DL
  techniques to physical problems without really changing them. These
  works are nonetheless often highly interesting and much needed to
  establish methodologies of how DL can be best used for physical
  problems.

In practice, these categories only serve as a rough guide to the space
of methods in the area of physics-based deep learning, and there are
many works below that combine aspects from more than one of these
classes.

This repository collects links to works on /deep learning algorithms for
physics problems/, with a particular emphasis on /fluid flow/, i.e.,
Navier-Stokes related problems. It especially collects links to the
works of the I15 lab at TUM, as well as miscellaneous works from other
groups. This is by no means a complete list, so let us know if you come
across additional papers in this area. We intentionally also focus on
works from the /deep learning/ field, not machine learning in general.
